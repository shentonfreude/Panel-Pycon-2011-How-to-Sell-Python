March 11th 2:55 p.m. â€“ 3:25 p.m.

How successfully introduced
===========================

Deploying Trac (with SVN), the first developer-oriented issue tracker at NASA HQ.

Deploying Trac (with SVN) at EPA OPP to replace proprietary issue
tracker (and repo): much happier users, much lower cost (no licensing,
no Oracle).

Semweb expertise locator project: Pylons, together with Java, non-SQL DBs

Use of Plone for public-facing NASA Science website: handled slashdotting, etc

Use of Django (with pip) for re-implementing

Use of Buildout and Fabric for deploying new versions

Worked with FBI to help redeploy fbi.gov with Plone, which they prefer for
its security record and flexibility.

Tools to Sell Python
====================


Pitfalls to Avoid
=================

Change, Lack of local skills:

> But our developers are experts in Visual Basic

Failure: can mark any tech for death

> This wouldn't have taken so long using Cold Fusion

Overcoming Resistence to Change
===============================

Be successful, quickly

Show how Python-based tools can help for non-Python projects (e.g.,
Trac, Fabric)

Show savings in cost/time, or ability to be more flexible.

Deploy some tools for non-Python users to use, or play with, e.g., a
community site for developers or projets based on Plone or Pinax.

Fight FUD with success: don't tell, do.  Offer to do a rapid prototype.

(We did a bake-off between Django+FeinCMS and Repoze.BFG -- knowing
we'd be happy with either choice they declared the winner.)

Tools to help sell
==================

"Google uses it" :-)

Managers who been marketed hard by well-paid salesdoirds: ColdFusion,
Java, Oracle, .NET, ...

We need to let people know that Python isn't a toy language for
hippies.  Give examples.

Migration and evolution vs. revolutionary change.
